        This method can be overwritten by backend implementations to
        open a network connection.

        It's up to the backend implementation to track the status of
        a network connection if it's needed by the backend.

        This method can be called by applications to force a single
        network connection to be used when sending mails. See the
        send_messages() method of the SMTP backend for a reference
        implementation.

        The default implementation does nothing.
